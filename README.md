**Node.js and Dependencies**
**Install Node.js**: If you're running a server (like your server.js for the API), make sure Node.js is installed on the new machine.
You can download it from the official Node.js website.

Install Project Dependencies: This server project has dependencies (e.g., express, ws, body-parser), you'll need to install them.

Open a terminal in the server folder and run:

npm install

This will install the required dependencies based on the package.json file in your project folder.
